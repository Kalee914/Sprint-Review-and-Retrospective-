# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I will use user stories to interpret user needs and implement them into a program. User Stories are helpful in developing a program because it provides a standardized and concise way to explain the requirements in simple terms. The developers and users can easily understand the language in the user stories. The stories are valuable and clearly defined so that the Product Owner can evaluate the level of effort required. The requirements are broken down into small tasks with priority and size to build incrementally.

The Product Owner usually holds focus group meetings, interviews, surveys, emails, websites, and podcasts with the users / Stakeholder so the PO can gather the requirements for the user stories and backlog. 

•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I approach developing programs, I will review a few things with the Product Owner. Such as a brief reason for the requirements (user stories), detail of the requirements including features and functions, resources (Product backlogs), prioritizing and sizing backlog items, deadline, communication transparency, and constructive feedback.  

The agile process helps the development team deliver value to customers faster. It is based on collaborative decisions with the entire team and the iterative progression of deliveries. A large project is broken down into small tasks of deliverables in each sprint. Sprint is done regularly in iterated cycles. Therefore it provides more flexibility for the team to accommodate customer needs. 

I hope to incorporate communication transparency with my team and incremental build process from Agile Methodology into my future development. In an agile project, everyone in the team is responsible for planning and managing the effort of the work. Therefore, transparency in communication regards the work progress and issues are vital for the team. Also, incremental build processes by breaking big projects into small chunks are more manageable and can detect errors sooner. Hence, it is less overwhelming and more efficient. 

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means communicating effectively. Openness and Transparency are essential for all team members - to track work progress, address issues, and voice impediments and success. As I mentioned above, in an agile project, everyone in the team is responsible for planning and managing the effort of the work. Therefore, communicating well with each other, updating the most recent information, and being open to voices means being a good team member.
